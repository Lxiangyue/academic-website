abstract:Low frequency detection on the back of the moon is a research hotspot in recent years, and the Chang'e project in China has taken a step forward to it. In March 2018, The Chinese Academy of Sciences launched a pilot project of space science, which is ultra-long wavelength astronomical observation array background model project (known as "Hongmeng Project" in China). The ultra-long wavelength astronomical observation array consists of one mother satellite and eight daughter satellites, forming a spatially distributed interference array in the lunar orbit. Shielded from the Earth-originated radio frequency interferences, this mission will discovery the unexplored part of electromagnetic spectrum, and will become a milestone in radio astronomy and space exploration. 
Mapping the sky below 30 MHz using the array of satellites is a major goal of this mission. In order to obtain the whole high-accuracy sky map, conventional method is to continuously increase the satellites’ sampling time, so that the sampling data can approach to the full sampling data step by step.
A novel sky map repair method based on generative adversarial networks is  proposed by this paper. Generative adversary networks consist of a generator network and a discriminator network, which can achieve image-to-image translation by learning the correspond from image-to-image. Thus, this network can obtain the high-precision sky map from the low-precision sky map. Firstly, using the radio astronomy imaging algorithm to get low-precision sky maps from satellites’ sampling data. Then, the generative adversary networks are trained with the low-precision sky maps and the correspond high-accuracy sky maps as training sets. Finally, another set of low-precision sky maps are used as the test sets to evaluate the network results by comparing the similarity between the outputs of the networks with the high-precision sky maps. 
The simulation results show that the sky map obtained by this method is more similar to the whole high-precision sky map than conventional method both in the peak signal-to-noise ratio and in the structural similarity, which means that this method can achieve more accurate sky map than conventional method.
